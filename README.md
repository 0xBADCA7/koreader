Koreader
========

This is a document viewer application, created for usage on the Kindle e-ink reader.
It currently supports Kindle 5 (Touch) and Kindle Paperwhite. The devices need
to be jailbroken in order to install the application. Also, a kind of external
launcher is needed.

Koreader started as the KindlePDFViewer application, but it supports much more
formats than PDF now. Among them are DJVU, FB2, EPUB, TXT, CBZ, HTML.

Koreader is a frontend written in Lua and uses the API presented by the
Koreader-base framework. Koreader implements a GUI and is currently targeted
at Touch-based devices - for the classic user interface for button-driven
e-ink devices (like the Kindle 2, Kindle DX, Kindle 3, Kindle 4) see the
KindlePDFviewer legacy project or - especially for the Kindle 4 - have a look
at its fork Librerator.

The application is licensed under the GPLv3 (see COPYING file).
